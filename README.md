# Welcome
## Game development repository.

## Key pieces of game development:
###**Core Mechanic**
* What is the game going to function around?
* What choices can the player make?
* What is allowed within the game?

###**Theme / Setting**
* What is the overall look and feel?
* The __heart__ of the game.
* The player should always be able to recognize your game by this peice.

###**Environment**
* The look of the game is just as important as it's theme.
* Close attention to detail.
* Is this immersing the player in the experience?

**Ask yourself these questions before every commit.**
